## Introduction
This is an interactive website where a user can set an intention to study, meditate, or exercise. Once the user has chosen their category they can then input what (specifically) they would like to accomplish during that time, and set a timer for the length of the session. Once they click the "start activity" button a timer will display and they can start the countdown whenever they would like. When the activity is complete, they can log it (which will add it to localStorage) and it will show up in the right sidebar indefinitely (or until they clear localStorage). The user can, from there, choose to do another activity-- which will take them back to the main page.
